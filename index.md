## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3, Part 1
    This was an enjoyable lab in which we used initialization as well as arithmetic operators with I/O functions. The easiest part was coding each of the equations for BMR for each male and female, as it was straightforward. Once that was done, we were able to quickly move on to part two. 

Lab 5, Part 1
    This was also a fun lab. This lab consisted of if statements and converting from integer to double, which was easy for me and my partner. Our program correctly defined each of the dimensions of the rectangle. 

Lab 7
    This was the shortest lab only having one part, but it was also the easiest to complete. There were many if statements and boolean functions that were present. The code compiled and provided if we could park on a certain street or not. It also gave error messages if the input was invalid.
